# ChatChamber
A multi-user chatroom application using C

## How to Use:
For windows: use the 'client.exe' that is inside the Win folder. If you donot have any C-compiler installed, keep the 'dll' file in the same folder
where client.exe is stored.


For Linux: './client' to run the client and './server' to run the server and for compilation use gcc client.c -o client -lpthread
